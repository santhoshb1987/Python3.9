Loops in Python:
----------------
--->Why Loops
All programming languages need a way to execute block of code many times,this is possible with loops.

Python has two types loops
1. for loop
2. While loop

For Loop:
---------

The for loop in python is used to iterate over a sequence list,tuple,string or other iterable

While Loop:
----------
While loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until given condition is satisfied.

To iterate through list we use below cod.

my_list=[2,4,5,6,"hi"]
print(my_list[0])
print(my_list[1])
print(my_list[2])

But if we have more values we need to write more codes

To iterate through list we use for loop
 
my_list=[2,3,4,5,"hi"]
for each_value in my_list:
	print(each_value)

To execute a block of code many times

for each_valu in [4,5,6]:
	print("--------")
	print(each_value)
	print("--------")

for value in (1,2,3"hi"):
	print(value)

For each_char in "python":
	print("----",each_char)
	

even or odd number:
-------------------

my_list=[3,4,34,5,67,89,23]
for each in my_list:
	rem=each%2
	if rem==0:
		print(f'{each} is even')
	else:
		print(f'{each} is odd')
