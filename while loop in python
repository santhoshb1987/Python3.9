While Loop:
-----------

The while loop in Python is used to iterate over a block of code as long as the test expression(condition) is true.

We generally use this loop when we dont know before hand the number of times to iterate.

for each in range(10):
	print("welcome to loops")

to repeat certain number of times using range function but for real time we cannot use range to loop through.

while True:
	print("Welcome to loops")
	print("............................")

while cnt <=5:
	print("hello")
	cnt=cnt+1
