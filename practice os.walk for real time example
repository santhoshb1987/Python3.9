Practice with os.walk(path):
----------------------------

Platform independent Python script
How to do a system wide search for a file?


Linux operating system --> "/"
Windows operating system --> "C:\"

import os
import string
import platform
req_file=input("Enter your file name to search: ")

if platform.system()=="Windows":
	pd_names=string.ascii_uppercase   --> to get the letters in upper case
	vd_names=[] --> empty list
	for each_drive in pd_names:
		if os.path.exists(each_drive+":\\"):  --> it will check the Drive exists in the windows machine
			#print(each_drive)
			vd_names.append(each_drive+":\\")  --> it will add all the exisitng drives in list
	print(vd_names)
	for each_drive in vd_names:
		for r,d,f in os.walk(each_drive):  --> walk through the each drive
			for each_f in f:    --> file checking
				if each_f==req_file:
					print(os.path.join(r,each_f))
else:
	for r,d,f in os.walk("/"):
		for each_file in f:
			if each_file==req_file:
				print(os.path.join(r,each_file))
